## video-link-grabber

A small project I made to automate grabbing downloadable links of videos.

### How to use

Open the developer tools(F12) in the browser of your choice. Navigate to Console and paste the code in the command line.
Press Enter and you will see all downloadable links for videos if there are any.

## series-link-grabber

A improved version of the video-link-grabber that grabbs more links. It is not working currently and I working on fixing it.
